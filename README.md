## Installation Instructions - Microsoft Windows

#### I haven't certified the application with Microsoft, so it will give a warning on first start-up.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Double click the downloaded file.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. In the Windows warning box, click the "More info" link in the text at the top of the warning box.
<br/>

<br/>

## Installation Instructions - Apple macOS

#### KADE can be installed following the normal process for macOS.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/shawnbanasick/kade/blob/master/gifs/iconDrag.png" width="350" />
</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Double click the downloaded file.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Click and drag the KADE.app icon into the applications folder.

#### Version 1.2.0 is code signed and notarized by Apple, so there will be only one warning on the first startup after installation.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/shawnbanasick/kade/blob/master/gifs/macOS warning.png" width="350">
<br/>
</p>

#### If you have changed your default settings, you may get this warning:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/shawnbanasick/kade/blob/master/gifs/macos-catalina-alert-not-app-store.jpg" width="350">
<br/>
</p>

#### In this case, to open KADE you will need to reset your security settings to the defaults:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Open "System Preferences"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Click "Security & Privacy"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Click "General"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Click the lock in the bottom left and enter your password

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Under "Allow apps downloaded from:", select "App Store and identified developers"

<p align="center">

<br/>
</p>
<br/>
<br/>

## Installation Instructions - Linux

The application is packaged as an "AppImage" so it can be installed on most of the major distributions (Ubuntu, Mint, MXLinux, Debian, openSUSE, RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, etc.) On some distributions it will offer to install the software.
<br/>

#### After downloading, you will need to change the file permissions of the downloaded file.

1. Right click on the downloaded file.
2. Select "Properties".
3. Select "Permissions". (Example image from debian-based "MXLinux")
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/shawnbanasick/kade/blob/master/gifs/linuxPermissions.png" width="350" />
</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Change permissions to executable. (Check "Allow this file to run as a program")<br/>
<strong>Known Issue:</strong> I have not been able to get the icons to package properly in the Linux AppImage, so the ugly default window icons are used now. I am working on a fix for this issue.
<br/>
<br/>

#### Alternative installation

1. Donwload zip file from the code.
2. Extract zip file.
3. Open the terminal under the extracted folder.
4. Run a command "npm install"
(Also run audit command if instructed so by the alart message.)
5. Run "mpm start"

## Updates

I have not integrated automatic updating functions into the application. To update you need to uninstall the old version, then download and install the new version.

## Uninstallation Instructions

- In Windows, click the "Start" button, then click "Settings", "Apps", "KADE", and select "uninstall"
- In macOS, use Finder to go to the "applications" folder and delete the KADE application
- In Linux, locate the AppImage file of the old version and delete it.
